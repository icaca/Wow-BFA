    Key Information.lua: Store player key info in correct format
    
    In Key Information.lua, information about the current player is
    populated using numeric indices instead of string keys. Subsequent
    lookups of this information would fail.
    
    The bug seems to be masked for players in guilds since the guild scan
    will also repopulate the player's key information in the correct format,
    so the issue only gets observed by players without guilds:

    The version has been bumped to 3.42.
    
    Fixes #7 and #10.
